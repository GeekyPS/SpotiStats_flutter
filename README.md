# Spotistats 

An elegant Looking app which fetches stats like top songs, top artists from Spotify API to show it to the user on what they are listening how much of each, and what the world around them is listening.  

 ## Detailed Description
 
 - Frontend: The app is made using the Flutter SDK by Google and adheres to clean UI with static dummy data , making the data dynamic and fetching it from               already made backend would be appreciated
 - Backend: Authentication has been implemented and User's data has been fetched on we based NodeJS backend , link to which is [Spotistats Backend](https://github.com/ranjankuldeep/spotistatsunique), the NodeJS backend needs to be updated in order to send a response to the flutter app the data of users, access token and refresh token, which could be attached to the next http request to server to fetch data without Auth
